Quarterly Financial Feature Engineering - Feature Descriptions
=================================================================

This analysis aggregates transaction data into quarterly assessments
to provide more stable and meaningful financial metrics for loan eligibility.

Each quarter represents a 3-month period, allowing for:
- More stable financial ratio calculations
- Better trend analysis across quarters
- Reduced noise from daily transaction variations
- More realistic business cycle assessment

Debt Recovery Efficiency (Quarterly Assessment):
-----------------------------------------------
  • dso_days: Days Sales Outstanding - average time to collect receivables (quarterly basis)
  • cash_collection_ratio: Ratio of cash collected to total sales (quarterly average)
  • avg_payment_delay_days: Average payment delay across all transactions (quarterly average)
  • immediate_payment_rate: Percentage of payments received immediately (quarterly average)
  • high_delay_payment_rate: Percentage of payments delayed > 60 days (quarterly average)
  • dso_trend: Trend in DSO across quarters (negative = improving)
  • collection_ratio_trend: Trend in collection ratio across quarters (positive = improving)
  • quarters_of_data: Number of quarters with data

Financial Liquidity (Quarterly Assessment):
------------------------------------------
  • current_ratio: Current Assets / Current Liabilities (quarterly average)
  • quick_ratio: (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities (quarterly average)
  • avg_net_cash_flow: Average net cash flow per quarter
  • total_net_cash_flow: Total net cash flow across all quarters
  • cash_flow_volatility: Standard deviation of net cash flows (quarterly average)
  • cash_flow_trend: Trend direction of cash flows across quarters (positive = improving)
  • liquidity_trend: Trend in current ratio across quarters (positive = improving)
  • liquidity_stress_ratio: Proportion of periods with negative cash flow (quarterly average)

Cash Flow Synchronization (Quarterly Assessment):
------------------------------------------------
  • inflow_outflow_ratio: Total inflows / Total outflows (quarterly average)
  • cash_flow_synchronization: Consistency of quarterly inflow/outflow ratios
  • expense_coverage_ratio: Ability to cover expenses with inflows (quarterly average)
  • sync_trend: Trend in synchronization across quarters (positive = improving)

  • revenue_trend: Trend direction of revenue across quarters (positive = growing)
  • revenue_consistency: Inverse of coefficient of variation across quarters (higher = more consistent)
  • sales_receipts_lag: Weighted average delay between sales and payment (quarterly average)
  • revenue_growth_rate: Overall revenue growth rate from first to last quarter
  • quarters_tracked: Number of quarters with revenue data

Risk Scoring (Quarterly-Based):
------------------------------
  • debt_recovery_score: Score based on quarterly debt recovery efficiency (0-100)
  • liquidity_score: Score based on quarterly financial liquidity (0-100)
  • cash_flow_sync_score: Score based on quarterly cash flow synchronization (0-100)
  • sales_performance_score: Score based on quarterly sales performance (0-100)
  • overall_risk_score: Weighted average of all quarterly scores (0-100)
