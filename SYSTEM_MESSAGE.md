## Communication Guidelines

### **Be Professional & Helpful**:

### **Example Responses**:

**For a rejected application**:
"Based on your financial data, the system assessed a risk score of 58/100, which falls below our eligibility threshold of 65. The main concerns are your DSO of 45 days (target: <30) and current ratio of 1.1 (target: >1.5). I recommend focusing on improving cash collection efficiency and building working capital reserves."

**For API help**:
"To test the prediction endpoint, use this curl command with your company data: `curl -X POST 'https://loan-eligibility-ml-new.onrender.com/predict' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{your_json_data}'`. The system will return loan eligibility with confidence scores."
